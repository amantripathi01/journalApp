"""
Scenario 1: Test for successful creation of admin user
Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulCreationOfAdminUser
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createUser method can successfully create a new admin user by invoking the saveAdmin method of the userService.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock User object. Mock the userService to return the mock User object when saveAdmin is called.
  Act: Call the createUser method with the mock User object.
  Assert: Assert that the userService's saveAdmin method was called with the mock User object.
Validation:
  This assertion is to verify that the createUser method is correctly invoking the userService's saveAdmin method with the correct parameters. This test is significant as it ensures the correct functionality of the createUser method in creating new admin users.
Scenario 2: Test for handling of null user object
Details:
  TestName: testNullUserObjectHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createUser method can handle a null user object being passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to create any mock objects as the user object to be passed is null.
  Act: Call the createUser method with null as the user object.
  Assert: Assert that the userService's saveAdmin method was not called.
Validation:
  This assertion is to verify that the createUser method is correctly preventing the userService's saveAdmin method from being called with null user objects. This test is significant as it verifies the robustness of the createUser method in handling invalid inputs.
Scenario 3: Test for handling of user object with invalid data
Details:
  TestName: testInvalidUserDataHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createUser method can handle a user object with invalid data being passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock User object with invalid data. Mock the userService to throw an exception when saveAdmin is called with the invalid User object.
  Act: Call the createUser method with the invalid User object.
  Assert: Assert that an exception was thrown.
Validation:
  This assertion is to verify that the createUser method is correctly handling exceptions thrown by the userService's saveAdmin method when it is called with invalid user data. This test is significant as it ensures the robustness of the createUser method in managing invalid user data.
Scenario 4: Test for successful addition of user to cache
Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulAdditionOfUserToCache
  Description: This test is meant to check if the createUser method can successfully add a new user to the appCache after creating the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock User object. Mock the userService to return the mock User object when saveAdmin is called. Mock the appCache to add the mock User object when called.
  Act: Call the createUser method with the mock User object.
  Assert: Assert that the appCache's add method was called with the mock User object.
Validation:
  This assertion is to verify that the createUser method is correctly invoking the appCache's add method with the correct parameters after creating a new user. This test is significant as it ensures the correct functionality of the createUser method in managing the cache of users.
