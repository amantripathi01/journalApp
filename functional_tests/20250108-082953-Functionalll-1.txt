   - Expected Output: Only PDF files should be uploaded successfully
   - Edge Cases: Try uploading unsupported file types like PNG, JPG, etc

3. Test Case: Verify the functionality of the upload option in Functional Testing as an alternative to linking with Jira or Azure Devops.
   - Input: Jira ticket in PDF format
   - Expected Output: The system should successfully upload the Jira ticket without requiring a link to Jira or Azure Devops

4. Test Case: Verify the file is correctly sent as an array of object with fileName and content and prompt type from approostio side.

Non-Functional Test Cases:

1. Test Case: Check the performance of the system by uploading multiple Jira tickets as PDFs at the same time.
   - Input: Multiple Jira tickets in PDF format
   - Expected Output: The system should be able to handle the load and upload all the tickets without any errors

2. Test Case: Check the system's resilience by trying to upload a corrupted or password-protected PDF.
